## Architectural Decision Records

An architectural decision record (ADR) serves as a comprehensive document that outlines the significant choices made by 
a team concerning the software architecture they intend to construct. Each ADR elucidates the specific architectural 
decision, its contextual factors, and the anticipated consequences. These records are not static but rather dynamic, 
mirroring a lifecycle that charts the evolution and impact of these decisions over time. They serve as a valuable 
reference, capturing the rationale behind critical architectural choices and their effects on the overall system, 
promoting transparency and understanding within the team.
