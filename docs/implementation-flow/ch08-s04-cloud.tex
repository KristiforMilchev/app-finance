\subsection{Uploading to Cloud}
\markboth{Distributing}{Uploading to Cloud}

Previously, we've discussed a capability to publish \q{Web}-package to GitHub Pages (\ref{deploy-web}), but 
directly the same flow can be used to release our application on Cloud. A breaf example of Amazon Simple Storage 
Service (AWS S3) usage:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=yaml]
name: Deploy to AWS S3

on: 
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@main

    - name: Configure AWS Credentials
      uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
      with:
        aws-region: ${{ secrets.AWS_REGION }}
        aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
        aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
      env:
        AWS_S3_BUCKET: ${{ secrets.AWS_S3_BUCKET }}

    - name: Compile
      run: flutter build -v web --release --no-tree-shake-icons

    - name: Deploy
      run: aws s3 sync ./build/web s3://${{ secrets.AWS_S3_BUCKET }} --delete
\end{lstlisting}
