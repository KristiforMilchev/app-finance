\paragraph{Flutter Engine Embedder}

The Flutter Engine is window toolkit agnostic, meaning a capability to build Flutter embedders on one of the platforms 
not supported out of the box (i.e, iOS \& Android). That enables creation of custom solutions with the power and 
flexibility of Flutter with a distribution to anywhere, including smart devices, cars, and more.
