In today's fast-paced digital world, businesses strive to adopt innovative technologies to streamline their 
operations and deliver exceptional user experiences. Mobile applications have become indispensable tools 
for organizations seeking to engage with their customers, increase efficiency, and stay ahead of the competition. 
Flutter has emerged as a popular choice for building 
high-performance, platform-agnostic applications.

This book, "From Nothing to Market with Flutter: Desktop, Mobile, and Web Distribution" takes us to a comprehensive 
journey through the creation of a robust competitive application by using Flutter with no-server architecture (while 
\q{serverless} is mostly associated with cloud-based infrastructure). And go through building a powerful and efficient 
application together.

The primary focus of this book is to demonstrate how to leverage Flutter's rich ecosystem and no-server approach, 
to create a feature-rich (financial accounting) application. Throughout the chapters, you'll explore the various 
stages of application development, from conceptualization to deployment, while adhering to best practices and 
design patterns.
