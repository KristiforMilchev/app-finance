Dear readers, I invite you to join me on a journey into a platform-agnostic application development, starting from 
ground zero. Meaning, that we (me and, possibly, you) might know nothing about cross-platform or mobile development, 
\q{Flutter}-framework, \q{Dart}-language, by not having even an idea for the application; ideally, it might 
be chosen a market, which to shake (in our case, -- financial accounting).

That book might be misaligned with the concepts that you're following, respecting, or adepting; by representing the 
author's vision, that's why I invite you to argue with me (\emph{and kindly request your assistance in identifying 
possible errors and misprints}) on the pages of a repository that contains the sources of this book and an application 
that we'll develop together as reading through 
\href{https://github.com/lyskouski/app-finance}{https://github.com/lyskouski/app-finance}. And... 
who knows, may be your arguments will change the ground ideas of that book, and we'll republish it together. 
So, here are those statements:

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{3pt}
\setlength{\parskip}{0pt}

    \item Creating any program is similar to a pottery workshop flow, by taking amorphous idea and shaping it. Through 
    the time it can be changed an architectural style (homogeneous, layered, multitier, microservices, etc.), structure 
    (monolithic, distributed, hierarchical, etc.), even platform (from platform specific to serverless), and language. 
    It's all about being Agile, being adaptive to all external and internal challenges. Meaning, that the application's 
    revenue justifies any refactoring, including the possibility of re-creating it from scratch.

    \item Programming is not something about creativity, in its pragmatic meaning (\emph{no one, except the author, 
    will be able to accurately obtain the same result if the same initial situation is created}), but mastery 
    (\emph{how accurate, quick, balanced, and far-sighted will be your implementation}).

    \item Instruments (languages, frameworks, libraries, etc.) should be adapted to solve the problem instead of 
    adapting initial ideas to a capability of available / known tools.

    \item Instead of being \q{I}, \q{T}, \q{U}, or \q{M}-shaped, nowadays dictate us to be \q{\_}-shaped 
    (underscore-shaped). While the most scientists maintain a broad outlook with a narrow specialty (\q{T}-shaped), a 
    significant portion of programmers stand on an unstable foundation. Meaning that technologies are infinitely 
    replacing each other through the time via tick-tock model (characterized by periods of evolution and revolution) 
    and the most effective approach is to continuously expand one's fundamental knowledge (polymathy, \cite{Root09}) 
    by staying acquainted with the technologies in use. 
\end{itemize}

\noindent In case of having any discrepancies with this, the book may cause a rejection; and it's the best time to 
refund. Moreover, it is been started without any knowledge in mobile and cross-platform development, Flutter, Dart, and 
understanding the needs of "financial accounting" market. \q{ChartGPT} was used as a mentor, and \q{Midjourney} --
to generate a few images (including covers of that book), and "shared" some design insights.

Returning to the core themes of the book and the selected technologies, it's evident that businesses aim to embrace 
innovative technologies to optimize their processes and provide outstanding user experiences, all while ensuring 
broad platform compatibility. Not so far, Flutter (\emph{Dec 4th, 2018 -- version 1; May 10th, 2023 -- version 3}) 
has emerged as a popular choice for building high-performance, platform-agnostic (desktop, mobile, web) applications. 
And this book, "\emph{From Zero to Market with Flutter: Desktop, Mobile, and Web Distribution}", road us to a 
comprehensive journey through the creation of a robust competitive application by using Flutter with 
\q{no-server}-basis (while \q{serverless} is mostly associated with cloud-based infrastructure).

The central objective of this book is to illustrate how to harness the extensive capabilities of Flutter to build a 
comprehensive and feature-rich application. Across the chapters, we will delve into every phase of the application 
development process, starting from conceptualization and culminating in distribution:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Take basics in \q{Dart}-language and \q{Flutter}-framework, and how it enables cross-platform development.

    \item Gain insights into the design principles of an application development. 
    
    \item Go through User Interface and Experience practices to create an intuitive user interface.

    \item Discover how to incorporate essential features into the application with a forecast release planning.

    \item Explore strategies for securely interacting with external systems and ensuring data integrity.

    \item Master techniques for testing (unit, widget, integration, and performance tests) and debugging practices. 

    \item Configure the application distribution across all platforms (Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, iOS) to their 
    marketplaces, and explore strategies for ongoing maintenance and updates.
\end{itemize}

\noindent So, let's embark on this learning curve journey and keep \q{Flutter}ing.
