\subsection{Activating Sponsorship}
\markboth{Prototyping}{Activating Sponsorship}

Now that we've opted for a Freemium business model (portmanteau of "free" and "premium"), which is a pricing strategy 
combining free basic features with paid access to premium functionality (broken by us due to the open-source), it's 
time to implement a subscription page. 

Monetization is vital because, as we attract more users, the application demands greater attention and resources.
That's why, the subscription is not just about making money; it's about sustaining (the costs of development, 
maintenance, and support) and growing while delivering value to our users. It allows us to keep pace with competitors 
and invest in innovation.


\subsubsection{Adding Custom References}

For Windows, Linux, and Web releases the simplest way of adding a subscription would be to provide links to external 
services, that're specialized on crowdfunding initiatives:

\begin{itemize}
  \item  \href{https://github.com/sponsors}{https://github.com/sponsors}
  \item  \href{https://patreon.com}{https://patreon.com}
  \item  \href{https://donorbox.org}{https://donorbox.org}
  \item  \href{https://paypal.me}{https://paypal.me}
  \item  and many others...
\end{itemize}

\noindent Implementation of external links is possible by \q{url\_launcher}-package:

\begin{lstlisting}
import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';

class OtherWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  const OtherWidget({super.key});

  Future<void> _launchURL(String url) =>
    launchUrl(Uri.parse(url), mode: LaunchMode.externalApplication);

  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: () => _launchURL(
          'https://buymeacoffee.com/lyskouski'),
      child: Text('Buy me a coffee'),
    ),
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Enabling Purchases}

In-app purchases are required for mobile app stores since it cannot be used any third-party systems to handle payments
by the terms and conditions of marketplaces.

To work with Google and Apple subscriptions we need to be registered there as a trusted developers / companies. Google 
Play Developer account (\href{https://play.google.com/console}{https://play.google.com/console}; set up and create a 
subscription product in the "Store Presence" section) would costs us 25 Euro at once, Apple Store Developer 
account (\href{https://developer.apple.com}{https://developer.apple.com}; via Apple Developer account create App ID and 
configure the in-app purchase settings) - roughly 100 Euro per year. Don't forget about other marketplaces as 
Galaxy and Huawei Store, by example, since they may provide some extra bonuses and coupons for a services usage.

There would be a couple of steps to verify your identity, add bank account, sign documents (tax forms) and agreements.

As an example, for Apple Store:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Activate paid apps on page: \href{https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/agreements}{https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/agreements}
  \item Register Bundle ID: 
  \href{https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/bundleId/add/bundle}{https://developer.apple.com/.../add/bundle}
  \item Enroll small-business support: 
  \href{https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/enroll/}{https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/enroll/}
  \item Fulfill app definition: 
  \href{https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps}{https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps}
  \item Via "Features" $\rightarrow$ "In-App Purchases" [Create] and "Subscriptions" [Create] declare costs
\end{enumerate}

In-app purchases are differentiated by their applicability: consumables (applicable multiple times), non-consumables 
(once), subscriptions (interval payments). And three different ways to integrate them into Flutter application:
\q{in\_app\_purchase}, \q{flutter\_inapp\_purchase}, \q{purchases\_flutter}.
