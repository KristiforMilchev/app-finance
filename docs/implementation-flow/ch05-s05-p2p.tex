\subsection{Replicating Data}
\markboth{Unleashing}{Replicating Data}

Our implementation prioritizes data security and privacy by exclusively relying on in-app communication, which keeps 
a user data within the app's controlled environment. However, this approach, while enhancing security, can introduce 
some complexity in the process of synchronizing data between devices. 

However, a practical approach for enabling data transfer between devices involves leveraging Peer-To-Peer (P2P) 
connections \issue{123}{}. In P2P connections, devices communicate directly with one another, bypassing the need for a 
central server. This decentralized approach offers several benefits, including data sharing, synchronization, and 
collaboration. It also places a strong emphasis on user data control, as there is no involvement of a central server. 
This privacy and security aspect is especially crucial for sensitive applications, such as personal finance tracking.

P2P networks are capable of enabling data synchronization even when devices are offline or lack an internet connection. 
When these devices regain connectivity, they can seamlessly exchange data, making this feature valuable for applications 
intended for low-connectivity or remote environments. That's why P2P connections are well-suited for maintaining data 
consistency across multiple devices, ensuring that any modifications made on one device are swiftly replicated on others:

  /* ... properties declaration */
  AppSync() : super() {
    final id = getUuid();
    // Check if P2P enabled
    if (id != null && id.isNotEmpty) {
      enable(id);
      connect();
    }
  }
  // Get a white list of pears
  List<String> _get() {/* get list of accepted pears */ }
  // Verify connectivity
  void connect() {
    List<String> peers = _get();
    for (int i = 0; i < peers.length; i++) {
      trace(peers[i]);
    }
  }

    if (!peer.open) {
      peer.reconnect();
    }

      _status[id] = SyncPeer(id, peer.connect(id));
    } else if (!_status[id]!.connection.open) {
      peer.removeConnection(_status[id]!.connection);
      _status[id]!.connection = peer.connect(id);
    }

Overall, P2P connections offer an efficient way to sync data between devices, enabling real-time, secure, and 
collaborative experiences across various applications. Their decentralized nature provides users with greater 
control over their data, making them an appealing choice for many modern applications. In addition, generating and 
scanning \q{QR}-codes can facilitate an information sharing \issue{220}{} for a small chunks of data (3KB, 7,089 
numeric characters or 4,269 alphanumeric ones). As well as Near Field Communication (NFC), Wi-Fi Direct, or Bluetooth 
connection enables short-range communication between devices.
