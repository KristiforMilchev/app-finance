A distribution page to Windows Marketplace: 
\href{https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/home}{https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/home}.

Firstly, we do have to proceed with a registration form (as for the business case
\href{https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/registration/AccountInfo}{https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/registration/AccountInfo})
and pay the initial fee (roughly 80 Euro with TAX).

The easiest way to create an MSIX distribution for the project is to use \q{msix}-package and store generated installer 
on \q{Release}-page since from a configuration page the link to the package is required (\cref{})

\begin{lstlisting}[language=terminal]
# Install package
$ flutter pub add --dev msix

# To generate the MSIX-installer
$ dart run msix:create
\end{lstlisting}
