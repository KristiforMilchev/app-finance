\subsection{Microsoft Store}
\markboth{Distributing}{Microsoft Store}

To distribute a Windows app through the Microsoft Store, we should create a Microsoft Partner Center account
(\href{https://partner.microsoft.com}{https://partner.microsoft.com}). By going through the registration form, it 
would be needed to pay the initial fee (roughly 80 Euro with TAX). The registration would be a prerequisite for 
creating the distributable MSIX-build, since a few properties for the build should be aligned with the information on 
our Partner Center (\cref{img:d-windows}). 

The most straightforward method for generating an MSIX-installer for our project is by utilizing the 
\q{msix}-package \issue{209}{}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=terminal]
$ flutter pub add --dev msix
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=yaml]
# ./pubspec.yaml
msix_config:
  display_name: Fingrom MSIX
  publisher: CN=78144012-EC6A-4BE8-97BF-A392EF55482E
  publisher_display_name: terCAD
  identity_name: terCAD.FingromMSIX
  logo_path: web/icons/Icon-512.png
  capabilities: internetClient # permissions
  store: true # distributable package
\end{lstlisting}

\img{distributing/win-store}{Microsoft Store -- Product Identity}{img:d-windows}

\noindent As a tip, MS Store requires to use all zeros for the version definition:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=terminal]
[X] Package acceptance validation error: Apps are not allowed
 to have a Version with a revision number other than zero 
 specified in the app manifest.
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=terminal]
# Prepare Windows release
$ flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
$ flutter build -v windows \
  --build-name=${{ version }} \
  --build-number=${{ build_number }} \
  --release

# Generate the MSIX-installer
$ dart run msix:create \
  --version 0.0.0.0	\
  --output-path ${{ matrix.build_path }} \
  --build-windows false \
  --capabilities internetClient
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent MSIX installers should be signed with a certificate, to ensure that app installs and updates come from 
trustworthy sources. But in case of publishing to the Microsoft Store, the installation package will be signed 
automatically by the store. In addition, we may utilize App Center (\href{https://appcenter.ms}{https://appcenter.ms}) 
as an early access platform for the users; it contains own Analytics and Crashes that can be used across multiple 
platforms.

To streamline the distribution process, we might use MS Store CLI (command line interface), a tool designed to 
interface with the Microsoft Store submission API for publishing Windows apps to the Microsoft Store. To get started 
with this integration, we'll need to establish a connection between our Microsoft Partner Center account and an Azure 
AD application. We have to retrieve essential information like Tenant Name, Tenant ID, Client ID, and Client Secret. 

We would start from creating a new tenant at 
\href{https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/account/v3/tenantmanagement}{https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/account/v3/tenantmanagement},
by clicking on "Create", and completing the necessary information. Next, we'll access our Azure AD account using the 
new tenant credentials via \href{https://entra.microsoft.com}{https://entra.microsoft.com}. Within Azure AD, by 
navigating to "Applications", we'll proceed with a new registration (as a note, the "Redirect URI"-field might be blank).
Under the "Certificates \& secrets" tab, we can generate a new certificate. This certificate will be utilized by our 
CI/CD pipeline, especially "Value"-field within this certificate represents our "Client Secret" for the CLI. To finalize 
the configuration, we'll visit the User Management 
(\href{https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/account/v3/usermanagement}{https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/account/v3/usermanagement})
to associate the created "MS Entra application", and grant a "Development" access to enable package uploads.
