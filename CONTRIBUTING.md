Contributing to Fingrom (app-finance)
=======================

Any help is always welcome!

There are many ways to contribute, including writing code, filing issues on GitHub, helping to 
triage, reproduce, or fix bugs that people have filed, or helping out in any other way.

Quality Assurance
-----------------------

Creating tests are really valuable contributions to open source projects.

Development
-----------------------

A clean code, covered by automated tests, is the best that can be done and greatly appreciated.

The only convention that we're following described on our 
[Wiki Page](https://github.com/lyskouski/app-finance/wiki/Project-Notation)
regarding commits notation.

Grand Rules:
- raised issue as a precondition to start work (named commits)
- split changes to a logical chunks (avoid big bang changes)
- write automated tests (neglect manual QA)


Localization
-----------------------

Native speakers (and translators) are welcomed to improve our translations since most of them 
are done by automation tools. Check [Localization Details](./lib/l10n/README.md).

Outreach
-----------------------

Writing posts about the project in any social networks is a key factor to keeping it alive and
being in demand.

Releases
-----------------------

Writing release notes and blog posts, creating supporting materials (video, documentation) is
respected.
