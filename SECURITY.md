# Security Policy

Any issue can be reported directly to [Fingrom Issues](https://github.com/lyskouski/app-finance/issues):
- vulnerability will be considered the highest priority for fixing as soon as possible,
- bug would go to the top of the implementation backlog, as we put quality above everything else. 

If you have any concerns about the confidentiality of the information that will be shared with the identified issue, 
please use the email: [support@tercad.pl](mailto:support@tercad.pl)
